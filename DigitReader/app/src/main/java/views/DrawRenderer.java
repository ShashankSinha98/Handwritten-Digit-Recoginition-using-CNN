//The Canvas class holds the "draw" calls. To draw something, you need 4 basic components: A Bitmap to hold the pixels,
// a Canvas to host the draw calls (writing into the bitmap), a drawing primitive (e.g. Rect, Path, text, Bitmap),
// and a paint (to describe the colors and styles for the drawing).
import android.graphics.Canvas;
//The Color class provides methods for creating, converting and manipulating colors.
import android.graphics.Color;
//The Paint class holds the style and color information about how to draw geometries, text and bitmaps.
